# Design, Construction & Test Repository

## Aims of The Project
The aims of the project are to design and build a component tester using the STM32f4 Discovery board. The bare minimum to do is:
 - The resistance of a resistor from 100 Ω to 10 MΩ
 - The capacitance of a capacitor from 100 pF to 10 μF
 - The inductance of an inductor from 1 μH to 100 mH
 - The saturation current and ideality factor of a diode or LED

## Installation instructions
